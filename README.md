# React Food App

This is a basic food ordering application built with React. The application allows users to browse food items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. This project serves as a practice exercise to brush up on essential React concepts such as components, state, context, reducers, HTTP requests, custom hooks, refs, portals, and error handling.

## Features

- **Display Products**: Browse a list of available meals fetched from the backend.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove products from the cart, view the cart in a modal.
- **Checkout Form**: Fill in user details and submit an order, view the form in a modal.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch dummy meals data from the backend using a GET request (`/meals`).
- **Submit Order**: Send cart data along with user details to the backend using a POST request (`/orders`).
- **Error Handling**: Manage loading and error states effectively.
